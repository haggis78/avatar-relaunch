# avatar-relaunch
This is a re-launch of the original UPG Digital Humanities Avatar project, formerly hosted on another server, and now reconfigured to run on GitHub Pages.
The original Readme file on that repo read as follows:
# Avatar
This is the repository for the Avatar team project.
This repository was formed to create a website based on the Nickelodeon television series "Avatar: The Last Airbender." This website will be compiled of the characters and dialogue 
within the series and will be divided up into its three seasons.
